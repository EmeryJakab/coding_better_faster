## Workshop Schedule

### 9:00 - 9:30: Introductions
- Participants introduce themselves: name, job, an R project they've built or want to build.

### 9:30 - 10:00: Understanding Technical Debt (Benjy)

- The difference between "code that runs" and "code we can build on"
- Why we take out technical debt: cost of learning and cost of implementation

### 10:00 - 10:45: Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) and How They Can Help You Code (Abigail)
- How do LLMs work?
- Leveraging chatGPT for reduced learning time and reduced implementation time
- Large language models are in flux but good coding practices aren't

### 10:45 - 11:00: Break

### 11:00 - 12:00: Version Control with git and GitHub
- **Introduction:** 
  - Why we do this: tracking our changes and sharing our work
  - Local version control using git: initializing, pushing, and committing.
  - Collaborating with GitHub.
- **Exercise:** Fork, clone, edit, and submit a pull request on GitHub.

### 12:00 - 1:00: Lunch Break

### 1:00 - 2:00: Functions and Refactoring
- **Introduction:** 
  - Why we do this: organized, readable, modular code for fewer errors, better collaboration, and more reuse
  - The importance of functions in R.
  - Understanding parameters.
  - Code refactoring: creating DRY, modular code.
- **Exercise:** Transform a monolithic piece of code into functions.

### 2:00 - 3:00: Project-Level and Function-Level Documentation
- **Introduction:** 
  - Why we do this: Explaning what we did and why for other people and the future you
  - Purpose and structure of README files and Markdown.
  - Documenting functions in R with Roxygen comments.
- **Exercise:** Document a piece of R code.

 ### 3:00 - 3:15: Break

### 3:15 - 4:15: Unit Tests
- **Introduction:** 
  - Why we do this: making sure your code still works when you make a change
  - Automated testing vs. manual "eyeball" testing.
  - Unit testing in R using the `testthat` package.
- **Exercise:** Write unit tests for an R function.

### 4:15 - 5:00: Conclusion
- Summarizing the day's learning.
- Discussing the broader impacts of LLMs on R coding practices.
- Q&A and feedback session.
