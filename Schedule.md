# Schedule

## Introduction

* The difference between "code that runs" and "code we can build on"
* Why we take out technical debt: cost of learning and cost of implementation
* Leveraging chatGPT for to reduce learning time and reduced implementation time
* Large larguage models are in flux but good coding practices aren't

## Functions and Refactoring

* The importance of functions in R
* Parameters: thinking about what's going to change and what stays the same
* Code refactoring in R: creating DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), modular code
* Exercise: Transform a monolithic piece of code into functions

## Project-Level and Function-Level Documentation

* Purpose and structure of README files, writing in Markdown
* Documenting functions in R: Roxygen comments, inputs, outputs, function purpose
* Exercise: Document a piece of R code

## Version Control with git and GitHub

* Local version control using git: initializing a repo, pushing, and committing
* Using GitHub for collaboration 
* Exercise: Fork, clone, make changes, and submit a pull request on GitHub

## Putting It Together

* Exercise: Tranform 'running' code to a refactored, well-documented, version-controlled repo on GitHub

## Extra: Unit Tests 

* The significance of automated testing over manual "eyeball" testing
* Unit testing in R with the testthat package
* Exercise: Write unit tests for an R function using testthat
