## Benjy: 

"Hi, my name is Benjy, and I'm co-leading the 'Taking Out Less Technical Debt in R (with chatGPT)' workshop at the 2023 R Government and Public Sector Conference.

As a data scientist, I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to write robust, extensible code that doesn't just run, but can be built upon by both you and others. In this workshop, we'll be talking about three ways of taking code from "code than runs" to "code to build on."

The first is 'code refactoring' or improving your code's structure with functions and parameters.

The second is 'documentation' We'll explore how to write explanatory text about your code that can serve as a roadmap for others - or for yourself in the future.

Lastly, we'll go over 'version control' and walk through how to use GitHub for tracking changes in your code and for fostering collaboration.

"Hello, I'm [Y] and I'll be co-leading this workshop with [X]. My focus will be on how you can integrate chatGPT, the large language model developed by OpenAI, into your coding processes.

We'll see how chatGPT can help you understand new concepts and generate effective code and documentation. This changes the trade-offs on technical debt, letting you use better coding practices upfront to generate "code to build on" much faster - whether these concepts are new to you or not. 

Because while the specifics of large language models like chatGPT are evolving, the principles of good coding practices remain consistent.

We hope to see you at our workshop.
