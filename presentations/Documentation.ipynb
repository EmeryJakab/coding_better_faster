    "# Project Title: Resume Evaluator\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contains Python code for evaluating resumes for data science roles. It leverages AI models to generate and evaluate synthetic resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project contains three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `generate_resumes.py`: This module is used for generating synthetic resumes using an AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `gpt_prompt_software.py`: This module is used for evaluating the synthetic resumes using another AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `model_evaluation_formal.py`: This module is used to analyze the responses from the AI model and calculate cross-tabulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `main.py`: This script orchestrates the entire process by calling the functions in the above modules in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The project requires the following Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "- `openai`\n",
    "- `tabulate`\n",
    "- `json`\n",
    "- `unicodedata`\n",
    "- `time`\n",
    "- `requests`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ensure that all required libraries are installed in your Python environment. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the `main.py` script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main.py`: Main script that orchestrates the entire process.\n",
    "- `generate_resumes.py`: Module for generating synthetic resumes.\n",
    "- `gpt_prompt_software.py`: Module for evaluating synthetic resumes.\n",
    "- `model_evaluation_formal.py`: Module for analyzing AI model responses and calculating cross-tabulations.\n",
    "- `key.txt`: Your OpenAI API key (not provided in the repository, you have to provide it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The main input is a series of prompts defined in `main.py`, which are used for evaluating the synthetic resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a .csv file containing synthetic resumes and their evaluations, as well as a .txt file containing cross-tabulation tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo models. Please ensure you have API access to these models and have the necessary keys and tokens."
