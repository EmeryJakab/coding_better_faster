# Slide 0: Why Functions?
- Make your code easier to understand
- As things change, only need to update the code in one place
- Reduce the chance of making a mistake
- Have less overall code to edit
- Let other people use the functionality without having to understand everything

# Slide 0: Why Functions?
- Make your code easier to understand
- As things change, only need to update the code in one place
- Reduce the chance of making a mistake
- Have less overall code to edit
- Let other people use the functionality without having to understand everything
*Makes Your Code Cleaner*

# When to Function?
- Whenever you repeat yourself more than twice (or maybe even once); DRY
- When you have several complex steps going and you want to make your code easier to understand from a holistic point of view
-When your code won’t functionally be changing, but maybe it’s inputs will (you starting out by reading a csv, but you want to read from a database eventually)

# DRY Example
```
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)

df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# DRY Example
```
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}

df$a <- rescale01(df$a)
df$b <- rescale01(df$b)
df$c <- rescale01(df$c)
df$d <- rescale01(df$d)
```

# DRYer Example
```
df %<>% mutate(across(c(a, b, c, d), rescale01))
```

# Meaningful Names
- Names should reveal intent.
- Use descriptive, unambiguous names for variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Clear naming reduces the need for comments.

# Meaningful Names
- Your code will run the same whether you use functions or not, so maximize their value for human consumption of your code
- Make your functions names:
  - Short but clear what they do → longer is better if it makes it more clear
  - Function names should be verbs and arguments should be nouns (generally)
  - Use snake_case (I guess you could use camelCase, but don’t)

# What's Wrong with this Function?
``` 
calc <- function(d, x) {
  d * x
}
```

# Here's a Better Version
\small
``` 
calculate_total_price <- function(quantity, price_per_unit) {
  quantity * price_per_unit
}
```
\normalsize

# Here's a Better Version
\small
``` 
calculate_total_price <- function(quantity, price_per_unit) {
  quantity * price_per_unit
}
```

# Single Responsibilty Principle
- Functions should do one thing (SRP).
- Small functions that have limited scope are easier to test, debug, and understand.

# Too Complex

    !!sym(column_name) > mean(!!sym(column_name)),

# Avoid Side Effects
- Functions should not have unexpected side effects.
- Side effects make code unpredictable and difficult to debug.

``` 
add_flag_column <- function(data, column_name, threshold) {
  data[[paste0(column_name, "_flag")]] <- ifelse(
                                            data[[column_name]] > threshold, 
                                            "high", 
                                            "low")
}
```

# What's Wrong with This?
\small
``` 
add_flag_column <- function(data, column_name, threshold) {
  data[[paste0(column_name, "_flag")]] <- ifelse(
                                            data[[column_name]] > threshold, 
                                            "high", 
                                            "low")
}
```
\normalsize
The function modifies the input data frame *directly*. If the original data frame is used elsewhere in the code, it now has the extra column and possibly unwanted changes. This can cause *unexpected results* in other parts of the code that use the same data frame.

# How to Avoid Side Effects
\scriptsize
``` 
add_flag_column <- function(data, column_name, threshold) {
  data_copy <- data
  data_copy[[paste0(column_name, "_flag")]] <- ifelse(data_copy[[column_name]] > threshold, "high", "low")
  data_copy
}
```
\normalsize
Now, when you call this function, it will return a new data frame without modifying the original one.

# Comments Should Be Rare and Meaningful
- Comments should explain *why*, not *what* the code is doing.
- Clean code is self-explanatory; comments should be used sparingly.

# Comments Should Be Rare and Meaningful
- Comments should explain *why*, not *what* the code is doing.
- Clean code is self-explanatory; comments should be used sparingly.
**Let's go back to the `process_data` function**

# Lots of Comments is a Sign Something is Wrong
- *Excessive Comments*: When you see a lot of comments in a codebase, it’s often a sign that the code is too complex or unclear. This means the code itself isn’t doing a good job of communicating its purpose, and the comments are trying to compensate for poor readability or structure.
- *Outdated Comments*: Comments can easily become outdated or inaccurate as the code evolves, especially if developers forget to update them. This can lead to confusion and bugs.
- *Comments as a Crutch*: Relying too heavily on comments can act as a crutch for bad code. Instead of writing clean, self-explanatory code, developers might add comments to explain what the code is doing.

“A comment is a failure to express yourself in code. If you fail, then write a comment; but try not to fail.”--Uncle Bob

# Code Formatting Matters
- Consistent formatting improves readability.
- Use automated tools to enforce consistency.
