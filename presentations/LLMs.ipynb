    "\n",
    "A large language model (LLM) is a type of **deep learning neural network** (an algorithm inspired by the brain's structure, using layers of computational nodes to recognize patterns in data). Specifically, it's a variant of **transformer architectures** (a cutting-edge structure in machine learning introduced around 2017), which excels in processing language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM operates by handling sequences of tokens (tokens can be words, parts of words, or characters, depending on how the text is split up) and its primary job is to predict subsequent **tokens** (basically guessing the next word in a sequence). \n",
    "\n",
    "These models are massive, having billions of **parameters** (adjustable parts of the model that help it learn from data). A key feature of transformers is their use of **attention mechanisms** (a technique allowing the model to \"focus\" on different parts of the input with varying intensities), which help weigh the importance of different input tokens when generating outputs.\n",
