# Better Coding Practices in R (with chatGPT)

These materials are for use with October 18 workshop at the 2023 Government & Public Sector R Conference.

The target audience is:

* Comfortable writing code in R to solve data problems like reading in files, aggregating data, and making graphs

* Familiar with the concept of functions and how to write a function that takes inputs and returns outputs

* Interested in improving their code and processes to take "code that works" and make it "code that other people (or they in the future) can understand, run, and build on" via practices like documentation, code refactoring, and version control

* Wants to learn how to use chatGPT to get there faster in order to reduce technical debt upfront

## Workshop notes: 

This is an interactive workshop. Please bring a laptop and do the following ahead of time:

* Have the latest version of R and RStudio installed
* Have git installed and an account on GitHub
* Have an account on openai.com. (It does not need to be a premium account)
